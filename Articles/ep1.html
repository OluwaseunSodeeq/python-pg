        <h1> It's Python O'clock! 🐍</h1>
        <p>Everyone has their New Year's resolution, and one of mine is learning Python and expanding my skill set. <br>
            I had planned to start learning earlier this year, but today marks the official beginning of my journey—better late than never!</p>
        <p>
            As a frontend engineer, I have built with JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and more—but now, I’m taking on a new challenge: learning Python! <br>
        Why? Because AI fascinates me 🤖, and I see Python as the gateway to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and backend development. While I’m starting with Python fundamentals, my long-term goal is to dive into AI-powered applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Short-Term Goals
        Once or twice a week, I’ll be sharing: <br>
        🔹 Cool insights from my Python journey
        🔹 The similarities and differences between Python and JavaScript
        🔹 A summary of what I’ve learned
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe learning in public is the best way to grow, stay accountable, and connect with like-minded people. If you’re also on a Python or AI journey, let’s learn together!
