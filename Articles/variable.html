        What Are Variables?

Many definitions and analogies exist for variables, often shaped by how a tutor, instructor, or writer understands them across different programming languages.

As a JavaScript developer, I have come across explanations comparing variables to containers, boxes, and storage units. These are all valid interpretations. However, I believe the concept can be simplified even further.

Before we get there, let us first explore naming conventions and scope in JavaScript and Python variables.

Naming Conventions

A naming convention is a set of rules that guide how variables, functions, and other identifiers should be named in a programming language. Following these conventions improves code readability, maintainability, and consistency within a project.

✅ Best Practices for Naming Variables

• Use meaningful names that describe the stored data
• Variable names can include letters, digits from zero to nine, and underscores but cannot start with a number
• Always start variable names with a letter from A to Z or an underscore
• Use camel case in JavaScript, for example, userName
• Use snake case in Python, for example, user_name
• Use uppercase letters for constants, for example, MAX_VALUE

❌ Common Mistakes in Naming Variables

• A variable name with a number.
• Using special characters except for the underscore.
• Using spaces in variable names.
• Using reserved keywords such as let, private, def, and list.

Scope

Scope determines where a variable can be accessed within a program.

JavaScript Variable Scope

In JavaScript, variables can have one of three scopes.
 • Global scope means the variable is accessible throughout the entire program
 • Function scope means the variable exists only within the function where it is declared
 • Block scope means variables declared with let or const inside curly brackets are confined to that block

Python Variable Scope

Python follows the LEGB rule which consists of four levels.
 • Local scope means variables exist only inside the function where they are declared
 • Enclosing scope means inner functions can access variables from their outer function
 • Global scope means variables are accessible throughout the program
 • Built-in scope refers to Python’s predefined functions and keywords

While these naming conventions and scope rules are considered best practices, they are not strict requirements. They follow industry standards and enhance code readability and maintainability. However, there are other acceptable ways to declare variables beyond those discussed in this content.

So, What Are Variables?

In my opinion, variables are simply NAMES. Regardless of what is assigned to them, what truly matters is how we reference them in our code and how effectively they describe the assigned value.
